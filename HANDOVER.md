# TamaPoke — where things stand

Written 2026-08-20, updated through 2026-08-23, so work could resume after a
restart. Read this with `CLAUDE.md`, which is the permanent knowledge and is
**authoritative wherever the two disagree**.

## 0. Branch `feat/retire-and-release` (v3.6) -- HISTORICAL, landed long ago

Four things, all verified in the emulator; **nothing here has run on a board.**

1. **An early retire no longer banks the creature.** It is gone for good, and
   the next egg is NEUTRAL (`lastEnd = CER_RELEASE`) rather than blessed. It
   used to bank *and* bless exactly as an earned farewell does, so retiring was
   the good ending with a small tax: retire, check the egg, retire again, and
   farm blessed rolls for free. The one-day evolution penalty stays. Retiring
   one that HAS earned its farewell is unchanged -- it is the farewell.
2. **RELEASE on the party/box detail sheet** lets a banked creature go for good.
   It always asks first, and the creature does not fall through into the box.
   The box gained the same sheet: a box tap used to yank the creature into the
   party on one tap, and now opens the sheet with TO PARTY on it.
3. **The 3 s hold is gated on `uiCurrentScreen() == SCR_MAIN`.** It was gated by
   a list of screens to exclude, so it was live on the party screen -- where the
   grid overlaps `inPetZone` and the dialog's YES box sits on party slot 4.
4. **A sprite pack sent over `PUT` now unlocks its region without a reboot.**
   `sdScanRegionArt()` only ever ran at mount, so a region downloaded from the
   web installer stayed greyed out reading NEEDS PACK -- which looks exactly
   like the download having failed. This was reported from the board.

Tests: **34 suites, 34 passing** (`release_test` is new). Every guard was
negative-checked, and two of those checks were themselves found to be vacuous
before they were fixed -- see CLAUDE.md section 3.

Not done: a board has not seen any of it, and the installer has not been rebuilt
(`tools/build_web.sh`), so the published site is still v3.5.

## 1. What is live right now

| | |
|---|---|
| Published firmware | **v3.28**, live at https://reallyjustsomeguy.github.io/TamaPokeLANExp/web/ |
| Repo version | **v3.28** in `TamaPoke.ino`, merged to `main` and tagged, GitHub Release published |
| GitHub repo | fork `reallyjustsomeguy/TamaPokeLANExp`, of `DylanPDao/TamaPoke`, of `socquique/TamaPoke` (the original) |
| Dex | `DEX_COUNT` **1025**, `REGION_COUNT` 10, `GYM_REGIONS` 7 |
| Your board | last flashed **v3.20**; v3.21 and v3.22 have not been on hardware |
| Live creature | Venusaur L100, `iv=29/20/19/22 tr=0/16/9`, bond 84, 12 medals |
| Tests | 40 suites + `check_savefile.mjs`, all passing (`sprite_test` skips without sprites) |
| NVS headroom | measured on the board: `used=132 avail=372 total=630` entries |

**Landed since the August snapshot below:** the dex reached 1025; the save is
checkpointed and atomic (issues #3 and #4 closed); the web installer backs up
before flashing and verifies what it captured; and releases are cut from `main`
with `check_release.py` enforcing it.

**Not verified on hardware**, and the first thing to do with a board:

1. The power-key long-press flush — hold PWR and watch for
   `save: flushing (pwr long press)` *before* it dies. If it never appears, the
   AXP2101's long-press IRQ fires too close to its own cut-off and
   `XPOWERS_POWEROFF_6S` in `pwrSetup()` widens the window.
2. The installer's backup-then-flash handoff, the twice-asked port prompt, the
   IndexedDB history and restore-from-history. All of it is untested end to end.
3. `STATS`'s new `board=` line, which is the real `ESP.getEfuseMac()` rather than
   the emulator's fake one.

### Save backups (all in `backups/`, gitignored)

    save-2026-08-21-dragonair-L45.txt          <- the current one, use this
    save-2026-08-20-dratini-maxed.txt          <- Lv 14, an EARLIER state
    save-2026-08-20-pre-3.0.txt
    save-2026-08-19-charizard-MIGRATE.txt      <- the migration block
    save-2026-08-19-board2-marshtomp.txt       <- board 2's original game
    save-2026-08-18.txt

Restore = paste the whole block into the serial console at 115200, **including
the bare `IMPORT` line at the end**, which is the commit. Without it nothing is
written.

## 1a. First real two-board LAN session (2026-09-10) — three bugs, all fixed

Four boards, real hardware, first time `linknow.cpp` had ever executed. Full
detail is in `CLAUDE.md`'s TODO section ("Found on real two-board LAN testing,
real hardware, four boards"); this is the short version for picking work back
up.

**`FW_VERSION` is 3.23** (bumped for these three fixes; `README.md`'s badge
matches). The board on COM5 is flashed with it. **This is a local dev bump
only** — not merged, not tagged, not released, and `web/manifest.json` is
deliberately left at 3.22 rather than hand-edited, since the right way to move
it is `build_web.sh` (which also recomputes the JS cache-buster hashes), and
that is a bigger step than this session did.

**Found and fixed, flashed to hardware, not yet re-soaked:**

1. `focusSwap()` could put the same creature in both a party slot and the
   live pet's own checkpoint at once, if the checkpoint write failed partway
   through the swap. `Pet::save()`/`Pet::switchTo()` now return `bool`;
   `focusSwap()` only commits the party-side write if the checkpoint one
   landed. Regression test in `focus_test.cpp` using the emulator's
   `nvsFailWritesAfter()` fault injection.
2. A failing checkpoint write used to retry on every loop iteration while the
   screen was dimmed — ~250 `save: pet checkpoint failed` lines captured in
   under 200ms on one board. Now throttled to one retry every 5s
   (`Pet::retryDue()`), and the failure message says which stage failed
   (write vs. read-back verify) plus live NVS headroom, instead of one
   undifferentiated line.
3. Dismissing a mid-battle "rival left" message (guest quit) crashed the host
   with a TASK WATCHDOG timeout on the battle screen. Cause: `lanLeave()` —
   which shuts the ESP-NOW radio off and resets `lan.state` — was called from
   `btlRun()`'s exit but not from either of `battleTap()`'s two dismiss paths,
   so the radio was left running, uninitialised-but-not-torn-down, into a LAN
   screen that expected `LINK_OFF`. Both paths now call it. **Not yet
   re-confirmed against the original repro** (guest quits mid-fight, host
   dismisses) — do that before trusting it closed.

**Still genuinely open:**

- *Why* a checkpoint write fails at all. Captured with healthy NVS headroom
  (`used=202 avail=302 total=630`), so it is not a full partition. Worth
  re-watching now that #3 is fixed — a radio left running all session could
  plausibly have been destabilising something adjacent.
- One board's save got scrambled during live debugging BEFORE these fixes
  (a `WIPE` that did not fully clear NVS — `factoryReset()` never checks
  `prefs.clear()`'s return — followed by an `IMPORT` restore that also never
  got fully verified). It currently shows a Charmander/Abra/Squirtle party
  that matches neither the original save nor a fresh one. Emergency `EXPORT`
  captures from before any of that are in `backups/`, dated 2026-09-10, if
  it's worth trying to reconstruct. Two more real firmware bugs were found
  along the way and are NOT yet fixed: `factoryReset()` ignores whether
  `prefs.clear()` actually succeeded, and `IMPORT`'s serial handler is
  missing the `saveInhibited = true` guard that `WIPE`'s has before its own
  `ESP.restart()`.

**New tool:** `tools/debugger/` — a tkinter serial console + save editor,
built mid-session because the ad-hoc reconnect-per-command approach used
before it was itself causing `USB_UART_CHIP_RESET`. Decodes a live `EXPORT`
into an editable view (live pet, party, box, bag, rivals, both checkpoint
pairs), flags duplicate creatures and unconsumed checkpoint handovers
automatically, and has a one-click bug-report bundle. Everything above was
found using it.

---

## 1b. Why the checkpoint failed, and two false alarms (2026-09-10) — FLASHED, `FW_VERSION` 3.24

Answers § 1a's open question: **a stale `Pet::prefs` handle**, not NVS space
(headroom was healthy every time it was captured) and not corruption. After a
long session's worth of WIPE/IMPORT/save cycles the handle degraded; closing
and reopening it and retrying the identical write succeeded immediately, and
the fix — close/reopen/retry once inside `saveCoreSnapshot()` and
`savePlayerSnapshot()` on a write failure — has not recurred since. This is
what was silently blocking `focusSwap()`'s party swap ("RAISE THIS ONE" doing
nothing after a wild catch): the checkpoint write failed, `switchTo()` failed
with it, and nothing on screen said why.

**Two false alarms found chasing it, both in the newly-added per-key save
logging itself, not in the save path:**

1. `nick`/`tnam` (`Pet::save()`'s legacy-key block) logged a failure on
   *every* save, forever, even on a handle just proven healthy by the
   checkpoint fix above. Root cause: `Preferences::putString()` returns
   `strlen(value)` on success — **0** for an empty string, indistinguishable
   from its own 0-on-failure return. Both keys were legitimately empty
   (`nick` by design — empty means "show the species name" — and `tnam`
   because this save had never had a trainer name set), so every "failure"
   was really a correct empty-string write being misread. Fixed:
   `SAVE_STR_KEY` only logs when the write returned 0 **and** the value being
   written was non-empty.
2. A one-time default closes the `tnam` gap for good rather than just quieting
   the log: `Pet::chooseStarter()` now sets `trainerName` to `"TRAINER"` if it
   is still empty when a new game's starter is chosen, and `Pet::begin()`
   backfills the same default on load for any existing save that is past
   starter selection and still has an empty name (this device included).
   `renameTrainer()` still overrides it whenever the player actually sets one.

**Found but NOT fixed — real, but not what was observed this session:**
`link.cpp`'s `HELLO` exchange reuses a single `peerName` field for both your
own outgoing name and the peer's received name. Tracing it shows a genuine
corruption path (a side that receives a `HELLO` while still `LISTENING`, or
any `LINK_SQUADS`-state resend, echoes the *peer's* name back to them instead
of sending its own), but `TamaPoke.ino`'s `lanOffer()` has both host and guest
call `start()` immediately, so in practice — confirmed by repeated real
testing — squad exchange finishes before the resend timer ever fires and the
corruption path is never hit. It would only show up under packet loss during
pairing (what `lossy_test` exists to simulate). Worth fixing before it is,
not because it has been.

## 1c. The Poke Mart, and the QMI8658's pedometer engine does not work (2026-09-11)

**Shipped:** a Poke Mart tile (between EXPLORE and GYM on the axis) that turns
real steps into Pokedollars at 1:1, wallet capped at $999,999 -- the real
games' own money ceiling. `FW_VERSION` moved to 3.25 for it. See `pet.h`
(`Pet::wallet`/`stepsTotal`/`addSteps()`/`spendWallet()`), `items.h` (real
Poke Mart prices, researched not invented), and `pedometer.cpp`.

**The QMI8658's own onboard pedometer engine
(`configPedometer()`/`getPedometerCounter()`) does not work, and was
abandoned for a software step detector instead.** Worth the full story
because the failure mode looked nothing like a bug at every level checked:

- No `configPedometer()` call at all (assuming usable power-on defaults):
  zero steps from 12s of active shaking on a real board.
- Added `configPedometer()` with values scaled for a low-power ODR
  (`ACC_ODR_LOWPOWER_21Hz`, `configPedometer(17, 200, 100, 67, 7)` -- the
  library's own example's numbers, rescaled by the ODR ratio since the
  library's doc says those params are literal sample counts, e.g. "80 means
  1.6s @ ODR=50Hz"): still zero.
- Reverted to the library's own proven example values UNSCALED
  (`ACC_ODR_62_5Hz`, `configPedometer(50, 200, 100, 200)`, matching
  SensorLib's `qmi8658_pedometer_deprecated.ino`): still zero, confirmed live
  over serial both shaking it and genuinely walking with it.
- Rebuilt with ESP32 core `DebugLevel=verbose` and forced a clean reset to
  capture the full boot sequence: **no errors anywhere.** No "QMI8658 not
  detected", no CTRL9 handshake timeout (the specific failure `writeCommand()`
  logs on a real timeout -- and `configPedometer()` ignores that return value
  entirely, so it always reports success regardless), no I2C NACKs. The chip
  acks, the commands complete, the counter just never moves.

Widened the search from "does this work on our board" to "does this work at
all": nobody found, on any board, has this engine working through SensorLib.
The closest data point is an open, **unanswered** GitHub issue asking whether
anyone has gotten the chip's *other* onboard engine (AttitudeEngine, sensor
fusion) working either:
[lewisxhe/SensorLib#3](https://github.com/lewisxhe/SensorLib/issues/3) — no
responses, no confirmation either way, opened 2023, still open. Whatever is
wrong (library bug, chip firmware revision, an undocumented requirement) is
not specific to this board or this session.

Meanwhile two independent real projects on this same chip both bypass the
hardware engine entirely: `VolosR/stepCounter` (a Waveshare AMOLED community
project) and `Melaja/ESP32-S3-Smartwatch`, both doing straightforward
magnitude-threshold detection on raw accelerometer samples. `pedometer.cpp`
now does the same -- `getAccelerometer()` + `sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2)`, a rising
threshold crossing at 1.8g with a 100ms debounce (VolosR's own proven
values), polled every 30ms from `loop()` rather than every 2s, because a
software detector has to actually see the ~50-150ms footstep impact peak
rather than read an on-chip accumulator occasionally.

**First flash of the software detector ALSO read completely flat** -- zero
steps from both shaking and real walking, exactly like every hardware-engine
attempt before it. This time the bug was ours, not the chip's: `pedoPollSteps()`
gated every read behind `qmi.getDataReady()`, a `STATUS0` ready-bit check that
apparently never sets the way the library expects in this ODR/power-mode
combination -- silently returning 0 on literally every poll, indistinguishable
from "no steps" and just as thoroughly hidden as the CTRL9 dead end had been.
Dropping the gate entirely (a threshold detector does not need a
guaranteed-fresh sample; at 128Hz internal sampling against a ~33ms poll there
is always a recent value sitting in the register) and reading the
accelerometer unconditionally was the actual fix.

Added a diagnostic `ACCEL` serial command (`pedoLastMagnitude()`) specifically
because the earlier debugging had repeatedly been fooled by binary
pass/fail (wallet moved or it didn't) with no visibility into *why*. It
immediately paid for itself: a rapid poll (every ~150ms for 8s) during active
shaking showed real, sane, varying magnitude (0.23g-1.70g) for the first
time -- confirming the sensor and I2C path were fine all along, and the
earlier borrowed threshold (VolosR's 1.8g) simply never got reached by this
board/grip's actual motion. Lowered to 1.5g against that real measurement,
which **confirmed the whole pipeline end to end**: wallet and `stepsTotal`
both moved by exactly 10 during a real shake test read live over serial.
Lowered further to 1.35g from there for sensitivity, still against measured
hardware behaviour rather than a borrowed number -- see `pedometer.cpp` for
the constants and their reasoning.

Widened the threshold research afterward to other implementations on this
same chip for a sanity check, not because 1.35g looked wrong: VolosR uses
1.8g (simple crossing), Melaja's smartwatch uses a materially different
peak-valley state machine (~1.0g of deviation from the gravity baseline, so
effectively closer to a 2.0g raw peak, plus a 5-consecutive-step warm-up and
420-800ms inter-step timing gate), and a commercial hip-worn pedometer
(DigiwalkerSW200) uses 1.21g. The spread between just these three -- on
threshold *and* algorithm shape -- says grip/mounting/motion style dominates
over any single "correct" chip-wide number; 1.35g sits inside that whole
range and is the only one of the four actually measured against this exact
board.

**Also landed in the same session:** the Mart's rim scrollbar now uses the
real `UI_SCROLL_DAY`/`UI_SCROLL_NIGHT` palette pair (already defined and
contrast-tested in `palette_test.cpp`, just never wired up) instead of the
day-only colors every other paged screen still uses -- scoped to `SCR_MART`
only, deliberately not a global fix. The page-number text and a new
"tap: back" label are night-aware too, and tapping anywhere on the Mart that
isn't a button or the confirm dialog now actually goes back (previously a
stray tap silently did nothing, which the new label would have made a lie).
Separately, and unrelated to the Mart: the clock/settings screen's cancel
hint said "swipe up: cancel" in all six languages when the actual gesture is
swipe down (`onSwipeV`'s `back = dir > 0`) -- fixed everywhere.
`FW_VERSION` moved 3.25 -> 3.26 across this work.

## 1d. Pushed to GitHub, README rewritten, v3.26 actually released (2026-09-14)

This session moved the project from a personal local checkout to a real public
fork with a real release, and found two genuine release-tooling bugs doing it
— neither was in game code.

**The fork chain, and why the remote was wrong all session.** This repo is
`reallyjustsomeguy/TamaPokeLANExp`, forked from `DylanPDao/TamaPoke`, forked
from the original `socquique/TamaPoke`. The local `origin` remote was still
pointed at `eperdeme/TamaPoke` — a different, unrelated fork this checkout's
history passed through earlier — for the entire session; every push used an
explicit full URL to the real fork instead of `git push`/`git pull` on
`origin`. Fixed at the end of the session with `git remote set-url origin
https://github.com/reallyjustsomeguy/TamaPokeLANExp.git`. **If a `git log
origin/main` or a plain `git push` looks stale or goes somewhere unexpected,
check `git remote -v` first** — this is exactly the shape of bug that a
`git status` telling you "up to date with origin/main" will not surface.

**The README was rewritten end to end** — Game manual reordered to follow the
actual player journey (controls → time/leveling → actions/stats → region →
starter → egg → raising → evolution → exploring/battling/gyms/LAN → retiring →
deeper systems), several rounds of self-introduced duplication found and cut,
the Community forks section removed in favor of a two-line fork chain in
Credits, and the "Added in this fork" bullets rewritten to be accurate (the
pedometer is not called "software" to the player, LAN battles are described as
scanning over WiFi Direct rather than naming ESP-NOW). Screenshots regenerated
via `tools/make_screens.sh`, which had never actually included the Poké Mart
in its `SHOTS` list despite the emulator supporting the shot — see CLAUDE.md's
own section on why this three-list reconciliation rots quietly.

**The web installer was rebuilt for the current firmware** and every
`eperdeme/TamaPoke` reference still in `web/` (not just the README) was
repointed at the fork — `web/editions.json`'s `"repository"` field is the
functionally important one, since `installer.js` reads it to fetch release
history from GitHub's API; a stale value there silently shows the wrong
project's changelog, not just a wrong link.

**Cutting the actual release found two bugs, and the first diagnosis was
wrong.** `v3.26`'s first tag push failed `check_release.py` in CI. There is no
way to read a GitHub Actions job log without an admin token — even on a public
repo, the logs API returns `403 Must have admin rights to Repository` to an
anonymous request — so the only way to see what actually failed, short of
asking the repo owner to paste it, was a from-scratch clone reproducing the
workflow's exact steps.

1. **First fix (real bug, wrong culprit).** `check_release.py`/
   `check_installer.py` read text files with no `encoding=` argument, so both
   inherit the OS default codec — `cp1252` on this Windows machine, which threw
   `UnicodeDecodeError` on `README.md`'s em dashes. This reproduced identically
   in a fresh clone and looked exactly like the CI failure, so it shipped as
   The Fix. It was a real, worth-keeping fix (any non-UTF-8-locale machine
   would hit it) — but ubuntu-latest's CI runner defaults to a UTF-8 locale,
   so it was **never what actually broke v3.26**, and the retagged release
   failed again identically after this "fix" landed. Lesson: a local repro
   matching the symptom is not proof of the mechanism when the repro runs on
   the same OS that might be the actual variable.
2. **Second fix (the real bug).** The user pasted the actual CI log line by
   hand (the only working path, given the 403 above):
   `web/installer.js points at savefile.js?v=122683f213e38dbd, expected
   1e0c9406aa8d98ea`. Cause: this machine's `core.autocrlf=true` rewrites the
   committed LF-only `web/*.js` to CRLF on checkout, and `build_web.sh` hashes
   the working-tree bytes — so the stamped cache-key hash matched the local
   CRLF copy and nothing else. Fixed with a new `.gitattributes` forcing
   `eol=lf` for `web/*.js/html/json/css` on every platform, plus rewriting
   `build_web.sh`'s own hash/rewrite step to use raw bytes instead of
   `pathlib`'s text mode (`Path.write_text()` reintroduces platform-native
   line endings on write regardless of `encoding=`). Full mechanism in
   CLAUDE.md § "Releasing".

`v3.26`'s tag was deleted and recreated twice during this — once onto the
first (wrong) fix, once onto the second (real) one — before the retagged push
finally passed CI and published. No GitHub Release existed for either failed
attempt, so nothing public was ever rolled back; only the tag ref moved.
**Do not read this as license to casually retag a real release** — both
retags were confirmed with the user first, specifically because a pushed tag
is shared state.

---

## 1e. v3.27 and v3.28, hours later the same day (2026-09-14)

A separate session from § 1d, picking up right where it left off. Three real
firmware/test fixes shipped as v3.27, then a same-day installer-only v3.28
because of a release-ordering gap worth understanding.

**v3.27 (`d63ebc7`):**

1. `link.cpp`/`link.h` reused one `peerName` field for both the outgoing
   `HELLO` name and the incoming one — exactly the latent bug flagged but left
   unfixed in § 1b, because normal pairing always finishes before the resend
   path that would corrupt it. Fixed properly this time: a separate `myName`,
   written once in `begin()` and read only by `sendHello()`; `peerName` is
   now write-once from `onPacket()`, read-only for display.
2. A wild win or catch never set `btlWinUntil` (trainer-only), so it skipped
   the `audioMusic(MUS_NONE)` on that dismiss path — victory music kept
   playing straight into the main screen. Moved the stop to the
   message-queue dismiss instead, which fires after every win/catch/item-drop
   line has actually been read.
3. `focus_test.cpp` was asserting superseded behavior for a total checkpoint
   failure (claimed the incoming pet stays live in RAM for a later save to
   catch up — the real code rolls back to the outgoing pet instead, which is
   the correct call: leaving incoming live uncommitted would be the same
   duplicate-creature bug pointed the other way). Test and the matching
   CLAUDE.md § "1a" note on `focusSwap()` both corrected. 41/41 suites green.

**Then the installer got a real round of UX work and one real bug fix**
(`3df9cea`, `a3590b1`, `3429f4a`, `e81ebdb`): `backupThenFlash()`'s
programmatic `flash-button.click()` fired after several `await`s, and by then
the browser had dropped the "transient activation" `navigator.serial.
requestPort()` needs — so Backup-then-install silently did nothing, no
dialog, no error, nothing logged. Fixed by not forwarding the click at all:
a successful backup now relabels the real install button "Install now" and a
genuine click is what starts the flash. Along the way: the backup button's
color changed to the firmware's own "ready" green, which needed two CSS
specificity fixes to actually hold through its disabled/hover states, and
esp-web-tools' own install dialog now shows `TamaPoke v{version}` instead of
a bare, unversioned "Install TamaPoke".

**Why v3.28 exists:** the installer fixes above landed as commits *after*
v3.27 was already tagged and released. GitHub Pages served the correct live
`web/manifest.json` throughout, but `installer.js` deliberately prefers a
matching *published release's* frozen content once one exists
(`hasCurrentRelease`), so nobody actually saw any of the installer work.
Rather than force-move the already-published `v3.27` tag — which § 1d's
closing note says not to do casually — this cut a proper `v3.28` through the
normal flow instead. Firmware itself is byte-identical to v3.27 except the
version string.

**The exact autocrlf/line-ending cache-key bug from § 1d recurred twice more**
(`bcb903c`, `b39cc38`), both times because the installer UX edits above
changed `web/installer.js`'s real content, which needed its cache-key
re-stamped in `index.html` — and the re-stamp briefly picked up a CRLF-tainted
hash again before being corrected against the actual committed git blob.
Both were caught immediately by `check_release.py` on CI, exactly as that
check exists to do, and both are fixed: as of this writing `web/installer.js`'s
real blob hash and `index.html`'s stamped value agree, verified directly
against `origin/main`, not just locally.

**Housekeeping found needed and done in a follow-up (2026-10-01):** this
session's one local commit (the § 1d/1e documentation writeup) had never
actually been pushed, and had drifted — rebased cleanly onto the real
`origin/main` once noticed (clean rebase: it and the one remote edit to
`CLAUDE.md` touched different sections). **If a local checkout of this repo
has sat for more than a day or two, `git fetch origin && git log
main..origin/main` before assuming it reflects what is actually live** — this
fork moves across multiple same-day sessions that do not always share a
checkout.

## 2. The dex expansion — exactly where it stopped

**Goal:** `DEX_COUNT` 386 → 493 (Sinnoh). Chosen because it is the only
generation where every piece exists: 100% sprite coverage, a `pret` disassembly
for verifiable gym rosters, and badge art already reachable.

### Done and working

- **Phase 0, committed.** `--check` over the whole table, `tools/check_sprites.py`,
  and `dexdata_test`. See `CLAUDE.md` § "Adding a generation".
- **Six Gen 1 evolutions linked** (committed): GOLBAT→CROBAT, ONIX→STEELIX,
  CHANSEY→BLISSEY, SEADRA→KINGDRA, SCYTHER→SCIZOR, PORYGON→PORYGON2.
- **The generators are now idempotent** — three consecutive `--emit` runs produce
  byte-identical files. They were append-only before and would have duplicated
  everything on a second run.
- **Data regenerated to 493 — COMMITTED** in `486bacb`, not sitting in the
  working tree as an earlier draft of this file said: `dex_data.py`,
  `dex_types.py`, `dex_stats.py`, `dex_learnsets.py`, `dex.h`, `moves.h`.
  `--check` reports **0 unexpected differences over 1..493**.
- **`--link` picked up Sinnoh's cross-generation evolutions by itself**:
  LICKITUNG→LICKILICKY, RHYDON→RHYPERIOR, TANGELA→TANGROWTH,
  ELECTABUZZ→ELECTIVIRE, MAGMAR→MAGMORTAR and one more. That is the rule working
  as intended — it needs re-running after every expansion.

### The pipeline, in the order it must run

    python3 tools/gen_dex_data.py --emit 493   # dex_data.py + dex_types.py
    python3 tools/fetch_pokeapi.py             # dex_stats.py + dex_learnsets.py
    python3 tools/gen_dex.py                   # dex.h        (needs the stats)
    python3 tools/gen_moves.py                 # moves.h      (needs learnsets)
    python3 tools/gen_dex_data.py --link       # link new cross-gen evolutions
    python3 tools/gen_dex.py                   # again, so the links land
    python3 tools/gen_dex_data.py --check      # must say 0 unexpected

`REGIONS` in `tools/dex_data.py` needs its row added by hand — Sinnoh's is
already in (`('SINNOH', 387, 493, [387, 390, 393])`).

---

## 3. Not started

- ~~**Phase 2 — region gating.**~~ **DONE** (`05a28cb`) — see §7.
- ~~**Sinnoh sprites**~~ **DONE** (`6987c83`) — all 214 files packed, every
  region 100%, `thumbs.bin` regenerated at 493, installer shipping v3.3.
- ~~**Sinnoh gyms and badges**~~ **DONE.** `GYM_REGIONS` is 4, `BADGE_REGIONS`
  is 4, and `verify_rosters.py` checks all three added regions against their own
  disassemblies: **0 of 39 trainers differ.**

  Sinnoh is **Platinum**: Fantina is the THIRD gym, not Diamond/Pearl's fifth.
  The level ramp only runs 14/22/26/32/37/41/44/50 that way, and `roster_test`
  fails a leader 8+ levels below the previous, so the wrong order fails a test.

  `GYM_REGIONS` 3 -> 4 is purely additive for saves: `badgesX[GYM_REGIONS - 1]`
  grows and `getBytes` leaves the shorter stored blob in the front of the bigger
  array, so Johto/Hoenn badges keep their meaning and Sinnoh starts empty.

  **The gym chooser now needs TWO pages** (4 ladders, 3 rows a page), so Sinnoh
  sits on page 2 -- `swipe_test` drives that mode specifically, because the
  dexpick case runs in a different mode and does not speak for it.
- **Trading.** Discussed, not started. `linkMonFrom`/`linkMonTo` already
  serialise a creature both ways, so the exchange is cheap; the hard part is
  atomicity (both sides commit or neither). **Do the radio bring-up first** —
  `linknow.cpp` has never executed on hardware, and building trading on an
  unproven transport means debugging two unknowns at once.

---

## 4. The three failing tests — ALL FIXED (`739a41c`)

Suite is **33/33**. Kept here because two of them are worth knowing about.

**`dexdata_test` — DARKRAI.** Fixed by adding **DARK PULSE** to `dex_moves.py`.
BITE and CRUNCH were the only Dark moves and both are PHYSICAL, so it was never
just Darkrai — every special-attacking Dark type had no special STAB. Darkrai is
SpA 135 / Atk 90 and learns DARK PULSE at level 27. Not added to `NO_ATTACK`,
which stays reserved for Ditto/Unown/cocoons.

**A move's index is its position in `MOVES`, and saves store it RAW.** DARK
PULSE is appended *after* STRUGGLE, not filed under DARK, because inserting
mid-table shifts every later move by one and silently rewrites the moveset of
every saved creature. `dex_moves.py` now carries an `APPEND-ONLY BELOW HERE`
marker. **Any future move goes at the end.**

**`roster_test`.** Asserted `GYM_REGIONS == REGION_COUNT - 1`, which the dex
outgrows the moment a region has data but no roster — the normal state mid
expansion. Now asserts what matters: no ladder for ALL, the table is exactly
`GYM_REGIONS` long, every ladder has a roster and a name.

**`hit_test` — the one worth remembering.** Its "near miss" taps on the egg
region pill were 8 px from the graphic, *inside* the 16 px hit area. They were
direct hits cycling the region twelve times, and it passed only because
`12 % REGION_COUNT(4) == 0` came full circle. Sinnoh made it 5 and it broke. The
dead guard band CLAUDE.md says this test protects **had never been exercised** —
trap 3, a test proving arithmetic rather than firmware. It now taps in the real
band, derives the offset from the rects it already queries instead of copying
`EGGREG_PAD`/`EGGREG_GUARD` into the test, and checks after every tap.

---

## 4a. The overnight runaway (`91aa43c`) — fixed and FLASHED

A player woke to a Dragonair that had run away **after a night of correct
auto-sleep**. It went to bed with all four bars at zero, which armed
`neglectTicks` at 60 *before* the screen went off. The sleeping branch of
`tick()` returns before the neglect block, so the counter was neither counted
nor **cleared** for eight hours, and `canRunawayNow()` read it alone. On waking,
a creature at 100 energy was one tap from gone — and `FAR_BTN` (y176-234) sits
inside `inPetZone` (y95-310) and is checked before the caress, unconfirmed. The
next tick cleared it 60 s later.

`tick()` and `canRunawayNow()` now both ask `Pet::inTotalNeglect()`, so the
counter cannot outlive the state that earned it. `sleep_test` has the
morning-after repro plus a guard that a genuinely empty creature on waking is
still ready to leave. FW_VERSION and the README badge moved to **3.2**.

Flashed and confirmed on the board: `TamaPoke fw v3.3`, pet intact through the
upgrade (NVS is never touched by a USB flash).

    arduino-cli upload -p /dev/cu.usbmodem1101 \
      --fqbn "esp32:esp32:esp32s3:CDCOnBoot=cdc,FlashSize=16M,PSRAM=opi,PartitionScheme=app3M_fat9M_16MB" .

Not done: `FAR_BTN` still overlaps `inPetZone`. The fix removes the cause, not
the delivery mechanism — it can now only fire on a creature genuinely empty
*right now*, which was judged the right line, but the geometry is still the
shape CLAUDE.md §4 warns about.

---

## 4b. Region gating and the installer (`05a28cb`, `6987c83`, `dee84f9`)

**The sprite pack is a real gate.** A region without its `.pak` on the card is
greyed in the chooser reading NEEDS PACK, denies on tap, is skipped by the egg
pill, refused by `setRegion()`, and excluded from the egg pool — `REGION_ALL`
filtering per species so a missing Sinnoh pack cannot put a Sinnoh creature in a
mixed egg. **Locked, never hidden.** Verified live on the board:

    art: KANTO  si
    art: JOHTO  si
    art: HOENN  si
    art: SINNOH NO (falta el pack)

`gRegionArt` defaults to ALL SET and is only narrowed by `sdScanRegionArt()`,
which probes THREE files per region (a half-copied 100 MB pack would pass a
single probe). That default is doing two jobs: no card keeps today's behaviour,
and `pet.cpp` stays free of SD symbols — it links into all 33 test binaries and
none of them build `sdmon.cpp`.

**The chooser is paged**, wraps rather than closing, and `rpickSwipe()` runs
FIRST in `onSwipe()` or the starter screen swallows the gesture. It is in
`swipe_test`, as every paged screen must be.

### The installer, and the trap in it

**The `.pak` files ARE committed and must be.** Release assets send **no CORS
headers**, so a browser `fetch()` of one is blocked — verified with an `Origin`
header: `200`, no `access-control-allow-origin`. `web/README.md` said the exact
opposite ("gitignored", "not committed", release "serves
Access-Control-Allow-Origin"); acting on it untracks them and breaks every
download button for everyone. That happened, in `06db7b9`, and was reverted in
`dee84f9`. The README is rewritten; **`.gitignore`'s comment was the true one.**

Second-order damage worth knowing: removing that bad ignore rule by truncating
the file also deleted the seven lines after it (`tamapoke.nvs`, `tools/_*.svg`,
`backups/`), and a `git add -A` promptly committed the save backups — whose own
comment reads "They were committed by accident once". Edit `.gitignore` by
replacing a block, never by slicing at an index.

`check_installer.py` still passes on every build, guarding both rules that each
destroyed a real save: four parts at their own offsets, and
`new_install_prompt_erase: true`.

## 4c. Unova (`feat/unova`) — DEX_COUNT 649

Two things happened here that had not happened in any earlier expansion.

**1. A region that is not 100% art.** 13 of Unova's 156 have no sprite upstream:

    514 516 520 522 523 538 558 564 565 591 592 616 626

They **keep their dex numbers**. Removing one renumbers every species after it,
and dex numbers are positional in saved data -- `dexReg` bits, `speciesId`,
every party record -- so a deletion corrupts existing saves. What is removed is
their ability to HATCH: `tools/check_sprites.py --emit` writes `noart.h`, and
`pickEggSpecies()`/`rollInRegion()` skip them. `region_test` rolls 2400 eggs and
fails if one appears. **Re-run `--emit` after any expansion and whenever
upstream adds art** -- several of these are base forms, so the list is doing
real work, not covering a theoretical case.

**2. A ladder with nothing to verify it against.** pret's DS disassemblies stop
at Platinum. Unova is therefore written from knowledge, which is precisely how
Johto and Hoenn were first written -- and `verify_rosters.py` later found TEN
errors in those, including two trainers carrying the wrong game's team. So:

- `trainers.h` carries a `*** NOT VERIFIED AGAINST A DISASSEMBLY ***` block
- `verify_rosters.py` prints a NOT VERIFIED section, so "0 trainers differ"
  cannot be read as covering Unova
- `roster_test`'s structural checks still apply, and its monotonic-ramp rule is
  what caught a wrong gym ORDER in Sinnoh earlier

It follows **B2W2**: Black/White's Striaton trio depends on your starter and
Drayden-or-Iris on your version, and one fixed ladder cannot express a choice.
Zebstrika, Throh and Carracosta are on it and have no art -- kept faithful, and
they draw as dex numbers.

**If a Gen 5 decomp ever appears, wire it into `verify_rosters.py` first.**

`check_sprites.py` also had to be fixed: it paged the GitHub API and `break`'d
on any failure, returning a partial set. Rate-limited, it reported all 156 Unova
species as art-less. That was survivable while it only printed a table; it is
not now that the output decides what can hatch. It fails loudly and prefers
authenticated `gh`.

---

## 5. Pitfalls — the ones that have actually cost time

### Build and test

- **A green emulator build does NOT mean the firmware compiles.** `build.sh`
  generates a `proto.h` with every prototype at the top; `arduino-cli` relies on
  auto-prototyping and rejects a function used above its declaration. This shipped
  once with 32 green suites. `tests/run.sh` now runs the real `arduino-cli
  compile` first — do not remove that.
- **Declare new sketch functions above their first use.** Same cause.
- **`const` at namespace scope is internal linkage in C++.** A table the tests
  need must be `extern const`, or the link fails with an undefined symbol.
- **Tests share one NVS store within a process.** A `Pet` built after another one
  slept will LOAD that sleep. Start each case from a known state (`sleep_test`
  has a `fresh()` helper for exactly this).
- **Negative-check every guard.** Break it on purpose and watch the test fail.
  This has caught a bad test roughly as often as a good one — `sprite_test`'s
  first version passed with the bug restored.

### Data and the dex

- **A move's index is its POSITION in `MOVES` (`dex_moves.py`), and saves store
  that index raw.** `gen_moves.py` does `idx = i + 1`; `Pet.moves[]` and
  `PartyMon.moves[]` write it straight to NVS. Inserting a move into its type
  section shifts every move after it by one and silently rewrites the moveset of
  every creature already saved — the live pet and every banked member, on every
  player's device. **New moves go at the end**, after STRUGGLE, under the
  `APPEND-ONLY BELOW HERE` marker. Same family as the box getting its own NVS key
  and badges being stored additively: never reinterpret bytes that already exist.
- **Anything holding a dex number is `int16_t`.** Never `uint8_t`, never the
  literal 151. This trap has fired five times: `evolvesTo`, `TrainerMon::dex`,
  `gen_moves.py`'s own `DEX_COUNT`, the Pokédex page cap, and `PmdMon::load` —
  which drew Ivysaur for Marshtomp and shipped in v2.8.
- **What hides it:** neighbouring code is usually already right, so the screen
  looks half-correct. `SdThumbs::get()` takes an `int16_t`, which is why the
  gallery was perfect while the creature on the main screen was somebody else.
- **A rule enforced in one path but not its twin** is the single most repeated
  mistake here. The TM gate (twice), the swipe paging bug (four times), the
  installer erase, the evolution threshold the card recomputed. Make every caller
  ask ONE function, and **test the caller, not just the rule**.

### The installer (both of these destroyed real saves)

- **The manifest must ship four parts at their own offsets**, never one merged
  image at `0x0` — `merge-bin` pads the gaps and writes 0xFF straight over NVS.
- **`new_install_prompt_erase` must be TRUE.** The name is the exact opposite of
  what it does: `false` means "do not ask, just erase the whole chip".
- `tools/check_installer.py` fails the build on either. `build_web.sh` runs it.

### Hardware

- **A stock board does not appear as a serial port at all.** Hold BOOT, tap
  RESET, release BOOT.
- **The board's RTC is months out** unless set (SETTINGS, or `RTCSET`). The sleep
  window depends on it; an unset clock never auto-sleeps, which fails safe.
- **Chrome holds the serial port** until the page that opened it closes. If
  `send_sd.py` says "Resource busy", close the installer tab.
- **Flashing over USB never touches NVS**; the web installer only leaves it alone
  because of the two fixes above.
- `EXPORT` before anything irreversible. It has been the safety net twice.

### The emulator

- `--save <path>` and `--wipe` keep experiments off your real save.
- `PANIC` / `WDT` at its console fake a crash so the boot report can be seen.
- It is launched here as a background process, so **it has no stdin you can type
  into** — drive it through a FIFO if commands are needed.
- It cannot see: timing, DMA tearing, PSRAM pressure, audio, battery, the radio,
  **touch accuracy** (synthetic taps are exact coordinates) or a missing
  `gfx->flush()`.

---

## 6. Older work still outstanding

- **LAN on two boards.** `linknow.cpp` has never executed. Treat the first
  session as debugging; `linkNowStats()` exists for it.
- **Battle background provenance** in `CREDITS.md` — the last licensing loose end
  before this goes public.
- **Audio by ear.** Nobody has judged the battle loop, the six cues, or whether
  `500 * vol` sounds linear.
- **A 24–48 h soak** on the current build. The last one passed at ~12 h.
